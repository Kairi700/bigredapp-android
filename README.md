# Big Red App for Android

## Download?
* Download it from the Play Store [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=is.genki.bigredapp.android)!

## iOS?
* The iOS version has begun work by Matthew Gharrity [here](https://github.com/gharrma/bigredapp-ios). Thanks Matthew!

## What
* It's still a pain to find Cornell University dining hall info on the phone...
* So, this is a native Android app to help people do that :)
* We are using [Kevin Chavez](https://github.com/mrkev)'s API [here](http://redapi-tious.rhcloud.com/).
* Recent screenshots [here](https://imgur.com/a/iul7J).

## Objectives
* 100% free as in beer (no monetization) and free as in speech (open source).
* App: native Android, easy to use, good looking, minimal, clean.
* Code: well-commented, easy to maintain.
