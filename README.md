# Big Red App for Android

## Why
* A while back, I made a cross-platform app (partly why it was bad) called Big Red App for the Cornell University campus.
* I originally made it so that it was easier to find open dining halls on campus, get menus, etc.
* But it was my first coding experience, it grew bloated and bad and so I took it off the app stores.
* Anyway, I realized I still really want a good version of this idea. But it's been hard to find time...

## What
* So, I'm making a much more minimal version of the app, native for Android, open source and free, all good things etc.
* Right now it just displays the dining halls, and if you tap on the meal-plan ones, it tells you today's menu.
* I'm very open minded as to where this project can go, but I do want to keep it as simple to use as possible.
* I am currently using [Kevin Chavez](https://github.com/mrkev)'s API [here](http://redapi-tious.rhcloud.com/).
* If you are interested in talking in person, I try to go to all [meetings](https://github.com/OpenSourceCornell/Meeting-Summaries/) of [Open Source Cornell](https://www.facebook.com/groups/opensourcecornell).
* If anyone wants to do the iOS version please say so and we can put them under the same umbrella!

## Where's the App Store link?
* This project will always be 100% free as in beer and free as in speech.
* I'll be putting it up on the app store sometime this Spring Break (March 28th 2015).
* Until then, see below.

## Contributing
* [Pull requests](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Contributing-to-a-Project) are very welcome :)
* Please do the same / better commenting style as is already in the code.
* My objective is to keep it very welcoming for beginners to contribute to (and I am still very much learning Android dev).

## Current TODO
* Currently the Jansen's Dining Room / Bethe House request is broken, try it in RedAPI.
* Display the location's name, not just its RedAPI id name.
* Add seperate Activity for a dining hall, displaying its information.
* Decide some format to filter what is currently open.
* Add request to RedAPI to get all dining hall's information in one.


## Open Soure Cornell IRC
* I try to remember to stay on the freenode irc at #opensourcecornell.
