# Big Red App for Android

## What
* It's still a pain to find Cornell University dining hall info on the phone...
* So, this is a native Android app to help people do that :)
* We are using [Kevin Chavez](https://github.com/mrkev)'s API [here](http://redapi-tious.rhcloud.com/).
* Recent screenshots [here](https://imgur.com/a/iul7J).

## Objectives
* 100% free as in beer (no monetization) and free as in speech (open source).
* App: native Android, easy to use, good looking, minimal, clean.
* Code: well-commented, easy to maintain.

## Download?
* It will be put up on the Google Play Store sometime this Spring Break (starting March 28th 2015).
* Until then, please see _Up and Running_ below, and contribute! :)

## Current TODO
* See the [issues page](https://github.com/genkimarshall/bigredapp-android/issues).
* Please post any issues for any questions / bug reports / ideas / etc. you have!

## Contributing
* [Pull requests](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Contributing-to-a-Project) are very welcome!
* If you are a beginner, please do not hesitate, as I am learning Android dev right now too.
